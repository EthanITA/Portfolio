      <p>
        <strong>Integrity</strong> is at the core of everything I do. I believe
        in doing what's <strong>ethical</strong> and <strong>right</strong>, not
        just what's easy. This means adhering to best practices, respecting
        client confidentiality, and always delivering on my promises. My work is
        guided by a strong moral compass, ensuring that every decision I make is
        in the best interest of my clients and their projects.
